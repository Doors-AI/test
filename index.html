<p> ON RACHMANINOFF'S BIRTHDAY <p>
<br />
Quick! a last poem before I go <br />
off my rocker. Oh Rachmaninoff! <br/>
Onset, Massachuesetts. Is it the fig-newton <br/>
playing the horn?  Thundering windows <br/>
of hell, will your tubes ever break <br/>
into powder? Oh my palace of oranges, <br/>
junk shop, staples, umber, basalt; <br/>
I'm a child again when I was really <br/>
miserable, a grope Piizicato.  My pocket <br/>
of rhinestone, yoyo, carpenter's pencil, <br/> 
amethyst, hypo, campaign button, <br/>
is the room full of smoke? Shit <br/>
on the soup, let it burn. So it's back.<br/> 
You'll never be mentally sober. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--Frank O'Hara, <i>Lunch Poems</i>, 1953
